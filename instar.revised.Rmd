## Model specification


Growth via moulting leads to discrete increases in size, accumulating more and more variability as growth variation accumulates across successive instars. 

The first eight instars follow a general growth trend
From instar VIII onward, maturation brings about a decrease in relative growth rate, as well as a notable increase in growth variability.

With this in mind, mean sizes instars I-VIII are held to have the

The largest instars overlap heavily leading with concommintant loss of clear modes in the distributions.

Unfortunately, selectivity of the trawl net is such that these sizes often dominate the sample distribution and so the structure of instars, namely their means and variances, must be made carefully. 

Unstructured mixture analysis of these data, though possibly leading to valid inferences for the smaller immature instars, often lad 

$$m(x) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j \phi(x | \mu_j, \sigma_j^2)$$
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
