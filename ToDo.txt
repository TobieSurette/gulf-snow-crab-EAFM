- Issues
- Extract some set data from bio data
- Create bibliography for EAFM project
- Create growth.R, maturity.R, mortality.R, etc... in population model.
- Finish gse2gsd reformatting
- Import nss catch data, make sure to include sample.weight, size-class
- Import and reformat length frequency data. Sampling ratio should be derived from catch where possible.
- Write sampling ratio function for this purpose.
- Make sure size class is in length-frequency data.
- Record one length and frequency per line?
- Create nssbio data from length data, include size class as an index (date, cruise, species, sample(size.class), fish.number?,
